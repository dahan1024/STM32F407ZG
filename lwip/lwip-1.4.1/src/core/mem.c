/**
 * @file
 * Dynamic memory manager
 *
 * This is a lightweight replacement for the standard C library malloc().
 *
 * If you want to use the standard C library malloc() instead, define
 * MEM_LIBC_MALLOC to 1 in your lwipopts.h
 *
 * To let mem_malloc() use pools (prevents fragmentation and is much faster than
 * a heap but might waste some memory), define MEM_USE_POOLS to 1, define
 * MEM_USE_CUSTOM_POOLS to 1 and create a file "lwippools.h" that includes a list
 * of pools like this (more pools can be added between _START and _END):
 *
 * Define three pools with sizes 256, 512, and 1512 bytes
 * LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL_START
 * LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL(20, 256)
 * LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL(10, 512)
 * LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL(5, 1512)
 * LWIP_MALLOC_MEMPOOL_END
